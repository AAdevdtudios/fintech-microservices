## Project Architecture

The application is structured as multiple microservices communicating with each other through REST APIs and Kafka messaging. The core services include:

- **Admin (Django):** Centralized management interface for handling users, wallets, transactions, and analytics.
- **Auth Service (Django):** Manages user authentication and authorization.
- **Wallet Service (Django):** Handles wallet operations like balance checks, transfers, and top-ups.
- **Transaction Service (Django):** Manages transaction records and processing.
- **Third-Party Integrations (FastAPI):** Facilitates communication with external payment gateways.
- **Kafka:** Used for message brokering across services.
- **Nginx:** Acts as a reverse proxy and load balancer for routing traffic to the appropriate microservice.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:**
  - Django (Admin, Auth, Wallet, and Transaction services)
  - FastAPI (Third-Party Integrations)
  - Kafka (Messaging)
  - PostgreSQL (Database)
  - Redis (Caching)
- **Containerization and Orchestration:**
  - Docker
  - Docker Compose
- **Web Server:**
  - Nginx

## Services Overview

1. **Admin Service (Django):**  
   Provides an admin dashboard to manage and monitor the entire system, including user accounts, wallet balances, transactions, and analytics.

2. **Auth Service (Django):**  
   Handles user registration, login, and token-based authentication.

3. **Wallet Service (Django):**  
   Provides functionality for wallet management, including adding funds, viewing balances, and transferring funds.

4. **Transaction Service (Django):**  
   Manages financial transactions and records.

5. **Third-Party Integration Service (FastAPI):**  
   Manages external API integrations such as payment gateways.

6. **Kafka:**  
   Facilitates communication between microservices, ensuring data consistency and reliable messaging.

7. **Nginx:**  
   Routes incoming requests to the appropriate service and provides load balancing.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Python 3.8+
- Kafka and Zookeeper (Included in Docker Compose)

## Getting Started
